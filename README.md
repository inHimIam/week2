week2 projects and information

I am having trouble with my flex not wrapping
I believe that it has something to do with the length/width of a parent but I am not sure how to fix the problem. 
I have spent a couple hours fiddiling around with it and reviewing materials but nothing has helped thus far.

The purpose of the project is to mimic the site https://www.wikimedia.org/ using our current knowledge to this point.

I noticed that the actual website is not using flex but thought that if I could impliment flex it would be much easier.
